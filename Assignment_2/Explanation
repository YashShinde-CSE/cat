SALARY SORTING PROGRAM – SHORT IMPORTANT EXPLANATION

• salaries:
  A list storing employee salary values (floats).

• selection_sort:
  - Finds the smallest element in the unsorted part of the list.
  - Swaps it with the element at the current position.
  - Repeats for all positions.
  - Uses two loops: outer loop selects position, inner loop finds the minimum.
  - Returns the sorted list.

• bubble_sort:
  - Compares each element with its next element.
  - Swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  - Largest value "bubbles up" to the end in each pass.
  - Repeats for all passes.
  - Returns the sorted list.

• salaries.copy():
  Used so that the original salary list doesn’t get modified.
  Sorting happens on a duplicate list.

• sorted_salaries_selection[-5:][::-1]:
  - [-5:] takes the last 5 elements (top 5 salaries after sorting).
  - [::-1] reverses the list to display them in descending order.

• Time Complexity:
  - Selection Sort: O(n²)
  - Bubble Sort: O(n²)
  (both have nested loops)

• Space Complexity:
  - Both use O(1) extra space (in-place sorting).

• Swap in Python:
  salary_list[i], salary_list[min_index] = salary_list[min_index], salary_list[i]
  Python allows swapping without a temp variable using tuple unpacking.

• Overall Purpose:
  Sort the salary list using two algorithms and print the top 5 highest salaries.
