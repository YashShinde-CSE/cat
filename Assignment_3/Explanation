TEXTEDITOR PROGRAM – SHORT IMPORTANT EXPLANATION

• TextEditor:
  TextEditor is a class. A class is a blueprint used to create objects.
  This class stores the document text and manages undo/redo operations.

• __init__:
  __init__ is the constructor of the class. It runs automatically when an object is created.
  It initializes:
      self.document   → stores current text
      self.undo_stack → stores previous states for undo
      self.redo_stack → stores undone states for redo

• self:
  self refers to the current object of the class.
  It is used to access the object's variables (self.document, self.undo_stack, self.redo_stack) 
  and methods. Without self, these variables would not belong to the object.

• Objects:
  When we write:
      editor = TextEditor()
  an object named ‘editor’ is created from the TextEditor class.
  This object has its own document, undo stack, and redo stack.

• make_change:
  Saves the current document in undo_stack,
  applies the new text change,
  and clears redo_stack because new edits invalidate redo history.

• undo_action:
  Takes the last saved state from undo_stack and restores it.
  The current state is moved to redo_stack so redo becomes possible.

• redo_action:
  Restores the last undone state from redo_stack.
  The current state is moved back to undo_stack.

• Stacks:
  undo_stack and redo_stack behave as LIFO stacks (Last In, First Out) 
  using list append() for push and pop() for pop.

• Key Idea:
  Undo and redo work by moving document states back and forth between two stacks.
