Here is the line-by-line explanation of the Real-Time Event Processing System using Queue — short, clear, and perfect for viva or pasting in Notepad.

REAL-TIME EVENT PROCESSING SYSTEM – LINE BY LINE EXPLANATION
------------------------------------------------------------

# Using simple list as a queue 
event_queue = []


• A list named event_queue is created.
• This list will act as a queue (FIFO → First In, First Out).
• New events go at the end, processed events come from the front.

def add_event(event):
event_queue.append(event)
print(f"Event '{event}' added to the queue.")

• Function to add a new event.
• append(event) → adds the event to the end of the queue.
• A message is printed confirming the addition.

def process_next_event():
if event_queue:
event = event_queue.pop(0)
print(f"Processed event: '{event}'")
else:
print("No events to process.")

• Function to process (handle) the next event.
• First checks if queue is not empty.
• pop(0) → removes the FIRST event (index 0), ensuring FIFO behavior.
• If queue is empty, prints "No events to process."

def display_pending_events():
if event_queue:
print("Pending Events:")
for idx, event in enumerate(event_queue, 1):
print(f"{idx}.{event}")
else:
print("No pending events.")

• Function to display all current events waiting in queue.
• enumerate(event_queue, 1) → gives index starting from 1 instead of 0.
• Prints each event in order.
• If queue empty → shows “No pending events.”

def cancel_event(event_name):
if event_name in event_queue:
event_queue.remove(event_name)
print(f"Event '{event_name}' has been canceled.")
else:
print(f"Event '{event_name}' not found or already processed."

• Function to cancel/remove a specific event.
• Checks if event name exists in queue.
• remove(event_name) → deletes the first matching event.
• If event isn't found → prints appropriate message.

def menu():
while True:
print("\n---EVENT MENU---")
print("1.Add Event")
print("2.Process Next Event")
print("3.Display Pending Events")
print("4.Cancel an Event")
print("5.Exit")

	choice = input("Enter your choice:")


• menu() controls the main user interface through an infinite loop.
• Displays a menu of options each time the loop runs.
• input() reads user choice as a string.
